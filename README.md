# GPII i18n Comparison

This repository compares the four candidates to handle internationalisation and localisation of strings in upcoming
work within the larger GPII, such as in the PCP.  The candidates are:

* [Infusion](docs.fluidproject.org/infusion)
* [i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next)

The code in this package wires up each candidate to perform a series of common tasks using the same sample data, in both
node and the browser.  Each example is only intended to exercise the package, and not to indicate how we would actually
use this in combination with gpii-handlebars.
